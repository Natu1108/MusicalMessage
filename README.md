# MusicalMessage
An encrypted message software made for my computer science class

## Required Packages
- tkinter
- mido
- os

(2/3 should already be installed)

## How to use it
When you run the program, it will show a Tkinter interface with intructions.
The steps you should start with:
1. Type your message into the encoding slot and click 'Submit'
2. Save your encoded message with a custom name
3. Decode any message by choosing the file (.mid) and clicking 'Decode'

Simple as that. I hope you find it as interesting as I did!
