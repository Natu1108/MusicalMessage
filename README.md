# MusicalMessage
An encrypted message software made for my computer science class

## How to use it
When you run the program, it will show a Tkinter interface with intructions.
The steps you should start with:
1. Type your message into the encoding slot and click 'Submit'
2. Decode said message by choosing the file and clicking 'Decode'

Simple as that. I hope you find it as interesting as I did!
